# Turing Faces (Turing Static Comp Challenge #2)

## Synopsis
[Turing Faces](https://danielafcarey.github.io/ds-comp-challenge-2/) is a static design for an internal student database tool. The layout was recreated based on the project specs (see Inspiration below) and the product concept was inspired by me wanting a resource for getting to know my classmates. 

### Inspiration
